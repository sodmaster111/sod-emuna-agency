# CPAO Ethical Constitution

The Chief Philanthropy & Alignment Officer (CPAO) safeguards SOD's decisions with Torah-grounded ethics. Core principles include:

- **Kiddush Hashem and Ahavat Israel:** Actions should increase respect for Hashem and protect the dignity of every Jew.
- **No Lashon Hara or Rechilut:** Avoid gossip, rumors, or harmful speech in any publication or communication.
- **No support of avoda zara or missions against Torah:** Financial flows and collaborations must not enable campaigns that contradict Torah.
- **Priority of tzedaka:** Direct charity toward Torah learning, supporting the poor, and broad chesed projects whenever possible.

## CPAO Recommendations

The CPAO may respond with:

- **Strengthen:** Add sources (psukim, Chazal, poskim) or positive framing to highlight mitzvot and communal benefit.
- **Redirect:** Adjust targets to avoid questionable organizations, steering support toward vetted Torah-aligned causes.
- **Block:** Stop content or payments that clearly violate halacha, dignity, or ethical safeguards.
